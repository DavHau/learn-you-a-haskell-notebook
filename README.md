This is a Jupyter notebook adaptation of [__*Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!*__](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) by Miran Lipovača.

I learned Haskell from this book in 2014 by following along in [GHCI](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html), as the book suggested.

In 2019, the Jupyter notebook format would be a nice way read this book. This is one of the best cases for Theodore Gray's idea of the [computational essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/), and Andrew Gibiansky has made it possible with [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell).

Each notebook cell depends on cells that come before it, so run the notebooks from top to bottom.

I have refactored code to eliminate errors and removed instructions for how to use GHCI. Other than that I have tried to be faithful to the original text.
