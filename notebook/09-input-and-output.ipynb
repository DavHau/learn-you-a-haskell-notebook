    "We've mentioned that Haskell is a purely functional language. Whereas in\n",
    "imperative languages you usually get things done by giving the computer\n",
    "a series of steps to execute, functional programming is more of defining\n",
    "what stuff is. In Haskell, a function can't change some state, like\n",
    "changing the contents of a variable (when a function changes state, we\n",
    "say that the function has *side-effects*). The only thing a function can\n",
    "do in Haskell is give us back some result based on the parameters we\n",
    "gave it. If a function is called two times with the same parameters, it\n",
    "has to return the same result. While this may seem a bit limiting when\n",
    "you're coming from an imperative world, we've seen that it's actually\n",
    "really cool. In an imperative language, you have no guarantee that a\n",
    "simple function that should just crunch some numbers won't burn down\n",
    "your house, kidnap your dog and scratch your car with a potato while\n",
    "crunching those numbers. For instance, when we were making a binary\n",

    "tree in place. Our function for inserting into a binary search tree\n",
    "actually returned a new tree, because it can't change the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "While functions being unable to change state is good because it helps us\n",
    "reason about our programs, there's one problem with that. If a function\n",
    "can't change anything in the world, how is it supposed to tell us what\n",
    "it calculated? In order to tell us what it calculated, it has to change\n",

    "of our program that is impure, which does all the dirty work like\n",
