    "give me a function that takes an `a` and returns a `b` and a box with an `a`\n",
    "(or several of them) inside it and I'll give you a box with a `b` (or\n",

    "> that helps people understand functors at first, just don't take it too\n",
    "> literally, because for some functors the box analogy has to be stretched\n",
